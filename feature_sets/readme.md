# BglB machine learning feature sets 

These feature sets are derived from various molecular modeling protocols. They should be named to recapitulate the directory hierarchy of the `rosetta_runs` (etc.) directories, using double underscores to indicate slashes. 

For example, if the computational protocol lives in 

`rosetta_runs/my_protocol`

then the feature set is named 

`rosetta_runs__my_protocol.csv`
